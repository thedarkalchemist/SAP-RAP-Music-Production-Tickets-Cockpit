🎵 Dark Alchemy: Music Production Cockpit 🎧
Managing Beats & SAP Cloud like a Pro
Welcome to my Music Production Cockpit! This is a full-stack SAP RAP (RESTful ABAP Programming Model) application built on SAP BTP (ABAP Cloud). I created this to solve two major challenges in my life.

🚀 Why I built this
Leveling up in the Cloud ☁️: I felt I was falling behind on the latest SAP Cloud tech. Building this cockpit was my personal "Magnum Opus" to master RAP, BTP, and OData V4.

Organizing the Lab 🎼: As a music producer (Dark Alchemy), I was getting lost in a sea of files and tickets. I needed a centralized place to manage my tracks and ensure nothing gets lost in the mix.

✨ What it does
Telegram Integration: With one click, I trigger a global action that sends a full production report to my Telegram.

Smart Prioritization: My bot is trained to sort tickets by importance. It shows me the critical stuff (New/To-Do) first, so I know exactly where the "fire" is. 🔥

Draft Protection: I've implemented logic to keep my database clean from empty "ghost" entries, ensuring a smooth management experience.

🛠️ Installation (How to run this)
Want to try it in your own ABAP environment? Follow these steps:

Clone the Repo: Use abapGit to clone this repository into your ADT (ABAP Development Tools).

Database Setup: Create the table ztmusic_cockpit and its draft counterpart based on the provided definitions.

Service Binding: Create a Service Binding (OData V4 - UI) and publish it.

Telegram Bot: You'll need your own Bot Token and Chat ID. Replace them in the send_telegram_direct method within the implementation class.
