# 🎵 Dark Alchemy: Music Production Cockpit 🎧
### *Managing Beats & SAP Cloud like a Pro*

Welcome to my **Music Production Cockpit**! This is a full-stack **SAP RAP (RESTful ABAP Programming Model)** application built on **SAP BTP (ABAP Cloud)**. I created this to solve two major challenges in my life.

---

## 🚀 Why I built this

* **Leveling up in the Cloud ☁️**: I felt I was falling behind on the latest SAP Cloud tech. Building this cockpit was my personal "Magnum Opus" to master **RAP, BTP, and OData V4**.
* **Organizing the Lab 🎼**: As a music producer (**Dark Alchemy**), I was getting lost in a sea of files and tickets. I needed a centralized place to manage my tracks and ensure nothing gets lost in the mix.

## ✨ What it does

| Feature | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Telegram Integration** | With one click, I trigger a global action that sends a full production report to my Telegram. |
| **Smart Prioritization** | My bot is trained to sort tickets by importance. It shows me the critical stuff (New/To-Do) first, so I know exactly where the "fire" is. 🔥 |
| **Draft Protection** | I've implemented logic to keep my database clean from empty "ghost" entries, ensuring a smooth management experience. |

## 🛠️ Installation (How to run this)

Want to try it in your own ABAP environment? Follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the Repo**: Use [abapGit](https://docs.abapgit.org/) to clone this repository into your ADT (ABAP Development Tools).
2.  **Database Setup**: Create the table `ztmusic_cockpit` and its draft counterpart based on the provided definitions in the `DDLS` folder.
3.  **Service Binding**: Create a Service Binding (**OData V4 - UI**) and publish it.
4.  **Telegram Bot**: You'll need your own **Bot Token** and **Chat ID**. Replace them in the `send_telegram_direct` method within the implementation class.
